Abstract

Errors and uncertainty in radar estimates of precipitation result both from errors in the basic measurement of reflectivity and from attempts to relate this to the precipitation falling at the ground. If radar data are to be used to their full potential, it is essential that effective measures are taken to mitigate these problems. The automatic processing of radar data that forms part of the UK Met. Office's Nimrod system addresses a number of specific sources of error. These include the identification and removal of spurious echoes resulting from anomalous propagation of the radar beam, errors resulting from variations in the vertical profile of reflectivity and radar sensitivity errors. Routine verification of the surface precipitation estimates has been undertaken, largely through comparison with rain gauge observations, over a range of timescales, which has allowed the benefits of the quality control and correction processes to be quantified. Although the improvement derived varies according to the dominant synoptic situation, an average reduction in the root-mean-square difference between gauge and radar data of 30% can be achieved.
